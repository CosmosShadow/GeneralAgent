Nougat: Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents
Lukas Blecher⇤ Guillem Cucurull Thomas Scialom Robert Stojnic Meta AI
Abstract
Scientific knowledge is predominantly stored in books and scientific journals, often in the form of PDFs. However, the PDF format leads to a loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions. We propose Nougat (Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents), a Visual Transformer model that performs an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task for processing scientific documents into a markup language, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a new dataset of scientific documents. The proposed approach offers a promising solution to enhance the accessibility of scientific knowledge in the digital age, by bridging the gap between human- readable documents and machine-readable text. We release the models and code to accelerate future work on scientific text recognition.
1 Introduction
The majority of scientific knowledge is stored in books or published in scientific journals, most commonly in the Portable Document Format (PDF). Next to HTML, PDFs are the second most prominent data format on the internet, making up 2.4% of common crawl [1]. However, the information stored in these files is very difficult to extract into any other formats. This is especially true for highly specialized documents, such as scientific research papers, where the semantic information of mathematical expressions is lost.
Existing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines, such as Tesseract OCR [2], excel at detecting and classifying individual characters and words in an image, but fail to understand the relationship between them due to their line-by-line approach. This means that they treat superscripts and subscripts in the same way as the surrounding text, which is a significant drawback for mathematical expressions. In mathematical notations like fractions, exponents, and matrices, relative positions of characters are crucial.
Converting academic research papers into machine-readable text also enables accessibility and searchability of science as a whole. The information of millions of academic papers can not be fully accessed because they are locked behind an unreadable format. Existing corpora, such as the S2ORC dataset [3], capture the text of 12M2 papers using GROBID [4], but are missing meaningful representations of the mathematical equations.
To this end, we introduce Nougat, a transformer based model that can convert images of document pages to formatted markup text.
The primary contributions in this paper are
• Release of a pre-trained model capable of converting a PDF to a lightweight markup language. We release the code and the model on GitHub3
• We introduce a pipeline to create dataset for pairing PDFs to source code
• Our method is only dependent on the image of a page, allowing access to scanned papers and books

#01 Nougat is a Visual Transformer model that performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on scientific documents, converting them into a markup language. It aims to enhance the accessibility and searchability of scientific knowledge by bridging the gap between human-readable documents and machine-readable text. The model has been released along with the code for future work on scientific text recognition. Detail in <<Nougat: Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents>>, <<Introduction>>, <<Related Work>>, <<Model>>, <<Data Augmentation>>, <<Datasets>>
#02 The content discusses the process of splitting a document into pages and predicting the page numbers for each paragraph. It also mentions the use of fuzzy matching to find the exact position within a paragraph. The content acknowledges that there may be artifacts and missing elements in the ground truth data. The results and evaluation section mentions the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. Detail in <<Page Index>>, <<Staircase Fit>>, <<Predictions>>, <<Figure 4: Splitting Paragraphs into Pages>>, <<Bag of Words Matching>>, <<Fuzzy Matching>>
#03 The model presented, Nougat, is an end-to-end trainable encoder-decoder transformer-based model for converting document pages to markup. It relies solely on the rasterized document page and does not rely on OCR or embedded text representations. The model has shown potential for extracting text from digital-born PDFs and converting scanned papers and textbooks. The model's utility is limited by factors such as repetitions and the need for improvements in handling different document styles. The model's generation speed is slower compared to classical approaches but can correctly parse mathematical expressions. Future work includes addressing the tendency for the model to collapse into a repeating loop and improving the handling of inconsistencies across the document.
